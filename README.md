Chat-with-MultiPDF-using-Gemini LLM" is a program or script designed to enable communication with multiple PDF 
documents using the Gemini Language Model (LLM). This code involves integrating the Gemini LLM API or library 
into a programming language environment, such as Python, and implementing functionality to extract text from 
multiple PDF files. Users can then interact with the program through a chat interface, where they input queries
or commands related to the content of the PDF documents. The program generates responses 
based on the extracted text using the Gemini LLM, allowing users to interactively engage with the contents of 
multiple PDF documents using natural language.
